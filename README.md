## Dependancies

The dependancies of this code are having the proper libraries which are listed below as well as intructions to install them. Additionally you must also have the csv file titled `health_data.csv`

## limitations

There are a few limitations in my program. One is that the projection of the users health is not all that accurate as it only uses linear regression to predict the users health.

## How it works

This repository should contain the following folders/files:
- csv data
- Final_testing.py
- Final_unit_tests.py
The `health_data.csv` folder contains computer generated health data as well as human inputted health data,
The `Final_unit_tests.py` file contains all the tests.
The `Final_testing.py` file contains the main python application.

To use my code you must download matplotlib.pyplot as plt well as sklearn.linear_model and import linear regression. You must also download numpy as np. 

to download sklearn.linear_model open your terminal and paste pip install scikit-learn
to downlaod matplotlib.pyplot open your terminal and paste pip install matplotlib
to download numpy open your terminal paste pip install numpy

Now you should have the libraries requried to run the code. 

You should expect the code to prompt you to enter personal parameters. 
Then, the code should generate four graphs. Two being boxplots and two being traditional XY graphs.
